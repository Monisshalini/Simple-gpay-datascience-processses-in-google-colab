Personal Spending Analysis
This project analyzes personal transaction data to provide insights into spending habits, visualize expenditures, and predict future spending. It leverages Python with pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations, and scikit-learn for predictive modeling.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values and identifies outliers.
Categorized Spending: Visualizes spending distribution across different categories.
Monthly Spending Trends: Tracks and visualizes spending patterns over time.
Next Month Spending Prediction: Uses linear regression to forecast the next month's total spending.
Budget Alert: Notifies if predicted spending is likely to exceed a predefined budget limit.
Installation
Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-spending-analysis.git
cd personal-spending-analysis
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required libraries:
Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
To run the analysis and generate the reports:

Ensure you have the transactions.csv file in the same directory as the script. (The script will generate this file from the provided data string if it doesn't exist).
Execute the Python script:
Bash

python your_script_name.py # Replace 'your_script_name.py' with the actual name of your Python file
The script will output the predicted spending for the next month and display several plots: "Spending by Category" and "Monthly Spending Trend." It will also generate a monthly_spending_report.csv file.

Data
The project uses a transactions.csv file containing simulated personal transaction data with the following columns:

user_id: Unique identifier for the user.
timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
amount: The amount spent in the transaction.
category: The category of the expense (e.g., Food, Shopping, Transport).
merchant: The merchant where the transaction occurred.
Example transactions.csv snippet:

Code snippet

user_id,timestamp,amount,category,merchant
1,2024-04-01 10:12:23,1200,Food,Zomato
1,2024-04-03 09:01:10,2500,Shopping,Amazon
...
Analysis and Visualizations
The script generates two key visualizations:

Spending by Category: A bar plot showing the total amount spent in each category. This helps in understanding where most of the money is being spent. 2. Monthly Spending Trend: A line plot illustrating the total spending month over month. This provides insights into spending patterns and fluctuations over time. ## Spending Prediction
A linear regression model is trained on historical monthly spending data to predict the total spending for the upcoming month. The predicted amount is then compared against a predefined budget_limit (set to ₹10,000 in the current script) to provide a budget alert.

Example output:

Predicted Spending Next Month: ₹XXXX.XX
⚠️ You may exceed your budget next month. Consider reducing expenses.
or

Predicted Spending Next Month: ₹XXXX.XX
✅ You are on track with your budget!
Files
your_script_name.py: The main Python script for data analysis, visualization, and prediction.
transactions.csv: The input dataset containing transaction records.
monthly_spending_report.csv: Output CSV file containing monthly spending totals.
